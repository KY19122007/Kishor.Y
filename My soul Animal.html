 <h1>My Soul Animal</h1>
 <p>My soul Animal is a "DOG".My soul animal is dog because dogs never  never cheat their owner. I like the honesty of dogs.I like the way dogs live.Dogs are loyal to anyone they see as their family. There are countless stories throughout history of dogs staying by their ownerâ€™s side even at great risk to themselves. If the dog power animal comes into your life, it may signify that you are a loyal and true friend. People who are experiencing loneliness or a betrayal may find the dog totem appearing in their lives as a reminder that loyalty exists.</p>
